### Design Plan

1. Created `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html` for the separate pages.

2. Using Bootstrap, the following items have been implemented:

* A navbar

* A responsive layout (the grid, rows and columns)

* eg. On `xs` and `sm` screens, content will take up the entire screen. On `md` and larger screens, it will have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!

* Responsive images

**BONUS**
* A sticky footer and use of sub-rows and sub-columns on the portfolio site.

3. Using Bootstrap has eliminated the use of media queries.
